# Contributors

## Creator and maintainer

- **SacredTrees** ([@SacredTrees](https://github.com/SacredTrees)): created and maintains these AmigaChrome stove builds. The compilers themselves are the work of their upstream projects, credited below.

## The AmigaChrome team

We are The AmigaChrome Team, who build the AmigaChrome stoves alongside SacredTrees:

- **Agnus**, our coordinator, who keeps every thread moving.
- **Thufir**, **Kynes** and **Galen**, who started the work on SacredTrees's x86 cores.
- **The threads**, each one taking a piece of the work from design to release.

## Fetched at build time, not committed

`aros68k-gcc16/build.sh`, `os4-gcc16/build.sh` and `rust-m68k/build.sh` download these, each checked
against the SHA-256 in their `sources.lock` (GCC and binutils also against
their GNU signatures), or at a pinned git commit. Every release that carries binaries also carries the exact
sources and patches they were built from.

## Our patches build on

`os4-gcc16/patches/` are our ports of the AmigaOS 4 support in the adtools
project to GCC 16.2.0 and binutils 2.47. That support is the work of Sebastian Bauer, Ola Söder,
Josef Wegner and the other [adtools](https://github.com/sba1/adtools)
contributors, carried on to GCC 15 and binutils 2.40 by Georgios Sokianos and
[AmigaLabs](https://github.com/AmigaLabs/adtools). The
patches are GPL, like GCC and binutils.

`rust-m68k/patches/llvm` 0002, 0004, 0006 and 0007 are backports of upstream LLVM
fixes by Dan Salvato (0002, 0006) and knickish (0004, 0007); 0001, 0003, 0005
and 0008 are ours. The M68k backend itself is the work of Min-Yih Hsu and the
other LLVM M68k contributors.

The AmigaOS NDK is not included and not fetched: it is not ours to
redistribute. Hyperion's AmigaOS 4.1 SDK is not included either: os4-gcc16
downloads it on the machine that builds the stove, and it never leaves that
machine.
