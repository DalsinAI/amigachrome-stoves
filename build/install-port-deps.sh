# install-port-deps.sh [--check-only] STOVE GAMEPORTS [SOURCE]
# Stages the codec inventory the game ports link (zlib, PNG, JPEG, FreeType:
# archives and their headers) into an AmigaOS 3.x stove, at
# prefix/m68k-amigaos/port-deps/ with its manifest.json. amigachrome-gameports
# recipes (AstroMenace, AssaultCube, UQM, NXEngine) refuse to build without it
# (DEPENDENCY_GATE_FAILED).
# GAMEPORTS is a checkout of DalsinAI/amigachrome-gameports: its
# toolchain/port-dependencies.lock.json pins every file by SHA-256 and its
# scripts/port_dependencies.py does the staging and checking, so the lock has
# one home. SOURCE holds the locked include/ and lib/ files (on Daletop,
# $AMIGACHROME_DEV/webkit-os32-040/m68k-amigaos); nothing is searched for or
# downloaded. Every hash is checked before anything is written, and only
# port-deps/ is written. A stove whose port-deps/ already verifies is left as
# it is; one that does not verify is not overwritten (move it aside first).
# --check-only only checks.
# A stove under ~/AmigaChrome/stoves is in use: set LIVE_OK=1 to write there.
# Undo: remove prefix/m68k-amigaos/port-deps/.
